# Video_classification_stage

During the project we had to classify a high content of video using different methode of classification. The first task, to classify video, is to use a pretraine model, VGG16, to extract the feature and use a type of reccurent neurone network, LSTM, to classify the content. The second task is to classify a set of statistics parameters which caracterize videos using different algorithm of classification. The set of parameters is save in csv file format.
